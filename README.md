# Price-Landing-Page
Price Landing is one of the task that is assigned by MotionCut during the period of 1 Month Internship. About Project: In this Pricing Page project, the objective is to demonstrate my skills in HTML and CSS by creating a visually appealing and user-friendly pricing page for a fictional product or service. The project includes building the page's structure and style using HTML and CSS, ensuring a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, and optionally incorporating JavaScript for dynamic elements such as interactive pricing toggles or hover effects. This hands-on experience will not only strengthen my fundamental web development skills but also provide you with the opportunity to showcase your creativity in designing a practical and engaging pricing interface.
